  ## Description

  ![Deployed Application](https://google.com)
   
   This workout tracker is built to help a user meet their fitness goals by tracking their workouts. The user can add all of the exercises as they did to a workout and save the workout when complete. The stats are aggregated in a dashboard that shows a week's worth of daily workout durations, total weight lifted, and what portion of the workouts were devoted to which exercises. 
   
    The application uses many different technologies on the front and back end. On the back end is an Express server deployed on Heroku and a Mongo database with Mongoose models hosted on Mongo DB Atlas cloud storage. The front end, developed by Trilogy developers, uses Semantic UI and Chart.js on top of the HTML/CSS/JS to make a clean and simple UI.

  ## FutureFeatures
- I would like to add the ability to view a completed workout to see which exercises were included
- I would also like to be able to delete old workouts. As of now, though only the previous 7 days are included in the dashboard totals, all older workouts are still being stored.
